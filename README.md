## Overview
In this project, we have to use different data set, clean them, merge together to create a database

## Results

## Summary

This project was a mess to deal with, with the giant storage and the challenges to push a commit with 
big file. The database I wanted to build wasn't built how I wanted. 

I think the project could have been done more efficiently through other methods such as clean the data
merge using pandas library then export the file
